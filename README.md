# Hyphen Wordpress Theme
Created using the _s base for wordpress themes.

Meant to be a minimalist base to be built on top of stylistically. 
The goal is that the only missing components will be color scheme and images.

## GOALS
- sidebar design
- sidebar responsiveness
- sidebar php integration
- sidebar minimizing
- color scheme setup
- css abstraction
- css to scss?
- find a good overall font
- style for blog posts
- style for forum 
- style for meta options (should be minimized)
- consider login integration
- assess additional XRP features


This theme is a practice project for working with the WP CMS, styling elements for blog posts, pages, forums, and more.

If all goes well, it might be adapted for the XRP project later this year.
